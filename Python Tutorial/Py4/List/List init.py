# `List` is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# `Py5` is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# `Set` is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# `Dictionary` is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.
